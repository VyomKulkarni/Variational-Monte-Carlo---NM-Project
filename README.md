# Variational-Monte-Carlo---NM-Project
We discuss the use of the Variational Monte Carlo technique in estimating the ground stateenergies of quantum mechanical systems such as quantum harmonic oscillator in one dimensionand three dimensions and trapped Bose-Einstein Condensates. We have also discussed in brief theMonte Carlo method, Metropolis algorithm and other topics which serve as a prerequisite for theVariational Monte Carlo technique.
